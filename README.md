# hello-world
This is my first time using **GitHub** & I'm a little excited about it

1. The first reason I'm excited is that I'm finally past the point of figuring out how to work a damn for loop.
2. Like number 1 but with the forEach method.
3. Wow I need to learn more programming don't I? :-D

Hopefully I find **GitHub** to be extremely useful. Here's a couple of websites that I've found useful as well...

+ [Google][1] Great for googling things I hear!
+ [Udemy][2] Great for... udemying things? 
+ [Reddit][3] Fantastic site for getting into arguments and feeling superior.

##### Here's just a few things I've learned so far!

```javascript
var array = [1,2,3,4,5];
for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
  array[i]++;
  console.log(array[i]);
}

// Outputs [2,3,4,5,6]
```

### Like I said, I might need to learn some more programming :-(
